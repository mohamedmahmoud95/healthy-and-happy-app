This is "Healthy and Happy"
a cross-platform app, built using Flutter and Firebase.
for Google DSC Solution Challenge 2023

"Healthy and Happy" provides a solution to the United Nations’ 3rd Sustainable Development Goal (Good health and well-being). 

"Healthy and Happy" is designed to promote physical and mental health awareness, with features like:
- Take a picture of your meal, the app will identify it and calculate the number of calories in it, and help you keep track of your nutrition sys.
- Sleep, stress level, and physical activity tracking
- Pedometer
- A social platform for community support
- Online sessions with mental health professionals
- Psychometric tests (Anxiety, Depression, and stress tests)
- Workout and nutrition tips
- videos and articles to spread awareness about mental health and health issues, and much more.
- With other minor, yet impactful features, like the weather forecast feature that reminds users to take a walk at the best time to get Vitamin D and fresh air.

Future upgrades:
- Daily challenges (30-minute walk, call a friend, …)
- BMI calculator
- multi-language support
- Connect with users' smartwatches to gather data on their health and mental health state to help them maintain a healthier lifestyle and assess whether their current lifestyle is helping them progress.
- Take a picture of the ingredients you have at home, a machine-learning model will identify them and suggest healthy and delicious recipes you can make with them.
